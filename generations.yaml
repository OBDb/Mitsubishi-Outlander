generations:
  - name: "First Generation (CU/ZE)"
    start_year: 2003
    end_year: 2006
    description: "The original Mitsubishi Outlander was introduced as a compact crossover SUV, initially marketed as the Airtrek in Japan before adopting the global Outlander name. Built on the GS platform shared with the Lancer, it featured car-like unibody construction with available all-wheel drive. The exterior design was relatively conventional with a tall, wagon-like profile. Powertrain options varied by market but typically included a 2.0L or 2.4L four-cylinder engine, with a high-performance turbocharged variant available in some regions producing up to 202 horsepower. Transmission choices included four-speed automatic and five-speed manual. The interior offered seating for five passengers with flexible cargo arrangements. This first generation established the Outlander nameplate but was relatively modest in its market impact, competing in the rapidly growing compact crossover segment against established rivals like the Toyota RAV4 and Honda CR-V."

  - name: "Second Generation (CW/ZG)"
    start_year: 2007
    end_year: 2013
    description: "The second-generation Outlander featured more distinctive styling with Mitsubishi's 'Jet Fighter' front grille inspired by the Lancer Evolution X. Larger than its predecessor, it moved into the mid-size crossover category and introduced an available third-row seat for seven-passenger capability. Built on a new platform shared with the Lancer and other Mitsubishi models, it offered improved handling and refinement. Powertrain options expanded to include a 2.4L four-cylinder, 3.0L V6, and in some markets, diesel engines. An electronically controlled all-wheel drive system called Super All-Wheel Control (S-AWC) derived from the Lancer Evolution was available on higher trims. The second generation introduced the first Outlander PHEV (Plug-in Hybrid Electric Vehicle) in 2013, combining a 2.0L gasoline engine with electric motors and a lithium-ion battery, though this variant had limited availability outside Japan and Europe during this generation. Interior quality improved significantly with better materials and available features including a Rockford Fosgate audio system, navigation, and advanced safety technology. This generation established the Outlander as a more substantial competitor in the crossover market with expanded capabilities and features."

  - name: "Third Generation (GF/GG/ZK/ZL)"
    start_year: 2014
    end_year: 2020
    description: "The third-generation Outlander featured more refined styling with a prominent chrome-accented grille, part of Mitsubishi's 'Dynamic Shield' design language. Built on an updated version of the previous platform, it maintained similar dimensions while offering improved noise isolation and ride quality. The standard seven-seat configuration continued in most markets. Powertrain options included an updated 2.4L four-cylinder and 3.0L V6, with continuous improvements throughout the generation. The Outlander PHEV became more widely available globally during this generation, featuring an evolved hybrid system with increased electric range and capability. The interior focused on improved quality with soft-touch materials, available leather seating, and enhanced technology including a multi-view camera system and advanced safety features. A significant refresh in 2016 brought updated exterior styling, additional sound insulation, and refined suspension tuning. Further updates in 2018 and 2019 kept the model competitive through a longer-than-typical production cycle. The third-generation Outlander, particularly in PHEV form, helped establish Mitsubishi's reputation in electrified vehicles while providing a value-oriented alternative in the increasingly crowded crossover market."

  - name: "Fourth Generation (PZ/PX)"
    start_year: 2021
    end_year: null
    description: "The fourth-generation Outlander represents the most substantial redesign in the model's history, developed after Mitsubishi became part of the Renault-Nissan-Mitsubishi Alliance. Built on a platform shared with the Nissan Rogue/X-Trail, it features dramatically more distinctive styling with a bold interpretation of the 'Dynamic Shield' front design, complex surface detailing, and a floating roof effect. Substantially larger than its predecessor, it offers improved passenger space particularly in the standard third row. The primary powertrain in most markets is a 2.5L four-cylinder engine producing 181 horsepower, paired with a continuously variable transmission (CVT) and available with an updated version of Mitsubishi's Super All-Wheel Control (S-AWC) system. The PHEV variant, introduced for 2023, features a significantly upgraded plug-in hybrid system with a 2.4L engine, more powerful electric motors, and a larger battery providing extended electric-only range. The interior represents a major leap forward with higher quality materials throughout, a modern design featuring a 9-inch touchscreen infotainment system, 12.3-inch digital instrument cluster, and available head-up display. Safety technology expanded substantially with Mitsubishi's MI-PILOT Assist system offering adaptive cruise control with lane centering and traffic sign recognition. The fourth-generation Outlander positions itself as a more premium offering while maintaining competitive pricing, demonstrating the potential benefits of the Alliance partnership while preserving Mitsubishi's distinctive character and all-weather capability focus."
